# lelbot

The (almost) original lelbot code

This version has a few changes, but it's very close to the actual lelbot

It would be very cook if you can help improve lelbot, or learn with this project!

## lelbot description

Lelbot is the bot that makes you go lel.

Imagine if there was a bot that could send lelbot in its cubed form doing a random task, then the word "bobux" in a weird way, then try to have a conversation with you and fail, then send a random sandwich, and them boom the entire universe. Lelbot *is* that bot.
